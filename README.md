# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Richard J. Walker


I am a Native Android Engineer, who is passionate about Mobile Development and a Kotlin enthusiast

Currently, I enjoy building side projects in my spare time to keep up with the latest mobile tech features to stay up to date.

My top interests at the moment include Kotlin Multiplatform, Android Development, and Server side using Ktor and Spring.

I'm always interested in collaborating with others with an exciting project idea, please feel free to reach out via LinkedIn and/or Email
